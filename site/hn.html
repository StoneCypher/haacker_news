    <p>Four score and seven years ago, our fathers established upon this continent a Government subscribed in liberty and dedicated to the fundamental principle that all mankind are created equal by a good God, <span class="audience">applause</span> and now we are engaged in a great contest. We are contesting the question whether this nation, or any nation so conceived, so dedicated, can longer remain. We are met on a great battle field of the war. We are met here to dedicate a portion of that field as the final resting place of those who have given their lives to that nation that it might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a large sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men lying dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. <span class="audience">Great applause</span> The world will little heed, nor long remember, what we say here; but it will not forget what they did here. <span class="audience">Immense applause</span></p>

    <p>It is for us rather, the living, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried forward. It is rather for us here to be dedicated the great task remaining before us; for us to renew our devotion to that cause for which they gave the full measure of their devotion. Here let us resolve that what they have done shall not have been done in vain. That the nation shall, under God, have a new birth. That the Government of the people, founded by the people, shall not perish.</p>

    <p>The conclusion of the President's remarks was followed by immense applause, and three cheers given for him, and also three cheers for the Governors of the States.</p>
